# Quest

This repo contains three python scripts for the coding challenge.

1. Jedi.py script is to find all ships that appeared in the film Return of the Jedi. This script will call the films api, filters the "Return of the Jedi" and stores the list of ship urls and loop the response of each url and store in a list and print the list in a loop
2. hyperdrive.py is to find all ships that have a hyperdrive rating >= 1.0. Here ship api is called and responses are stored and looped to print the rating >=1.0
3. crew_count.py is to find all ships that have crews between 3 and 100. Here ships are listed whose crew numbers ranges between 3 and 100. However the 3-165 with hyphen involved is not listed.
